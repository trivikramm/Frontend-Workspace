        <h1>About me:</h1>
        </div>
        <p>My name is Trivikram Majjari. I'm from Kadapa, Andhrapradesh. I have completed
            my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering with Specialization in 
            Data science. I have acquired 8.81 CGPA. I learned Java, HTML, CSS, JDBC, Javascript
            , Microsoft Azure, Git, Linux. I have also completed several projects that have helped me gain practical experience in these technologies. Some of my key projects include a real-time data analysis platform using Java and Microsoft Azure, and a responsive web application developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

            In addition to technical skills, I've honed my problem-solving abilities and teamwork through various collaborative assignments and hackathons. I am passionate about learning new technologies, and I'm constantly seeking opportunities to improve my skills.
            
            Currently, I'm focusing on enhancing my knowledge in cloud computing, particularly in Salesforce, as I believe it aligns with my career goals and the industry's future trends. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects and work in an environment that fosters growth and learning.
